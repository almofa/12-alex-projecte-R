                <p class="blog-post-meta">FEBRUARY 6, 2020 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>

                <p>There isn’t a layer of emotional resonance within which Sam Mendes’ latest feature does not excel. A
                First World War thriller, boasting the dramatic surety Mendes nailed in Skyfall and all but lost in
                Spectre, 1917 quickly takes hostage of the heart and refuses release. It is electric, devastating and
                charged with a profound sense for the absolute horror of warfare. That the story comes from the original
                experience of Mendes’ own grandfather on the Western Front is paramount. This one matters to him
                    sincerely.</p>

                <p>‘1917’ is actually a truncated title. More accurately, Mendes’ film ought to be named April 6 1917,
                taking place, as it does, almost entirely in real time and on that very date. Moreover, 1917 is
                presented as though captured in a single, entirely unedited, shot. Bar one or two flashes of black, each
                and every cut made is imperceptibly woven into a delicately achieved whole. The effect is marvellously
                involving and handled with intelligence enough to sidestep the accusations of gimmickry that normally
                descend on such creative decisions. Roger Deakins’ camera, beautifully mounted, pushes through all
                manner of traumas, from the flies swarming around dead horses to the barbed wire abandoned on no man’s
                    land. There is precious little focus: this is simply how it is and how one imagines it was seen.</p>

                <p>To this end, the film is not for the faint of heart. At every turn, corpses claw from entrapments of
                soil and rubble, desperately reaching for aid that will never come. Tonally too, the film is beset with
                paradigms of futility. If the plot concerns the valour of two young men in delivering orders across the
                hellscape of No Man’s Land, it is only to warn that the enemy ahead is simply too powerful to be beaten.
                Indeed, as we are lead through German trenches and fortification, it is only to the revelation that
                British infrastructures pale in comparison: ‘even their rats are bigger than ours’. And yet, hope will
                out. It must. Later, a recital of Edward Lear’s sordid Jumbles will close to the distant sound of church
                    bells calling. Crying out from a church that blazes and crumbles still.</p>

                <p>Far more than the sum of its technical achievements, 1917 is cast with equal panache. George MacKay
                (Where Hands Touch) and Dean-Charles Chapman (Blinded by the Light) lead as Lance Corporals William
                Schofield and Thomas Blake, one embittered and wary, the other tinged still with guns-ho naiveté, both
                tasked by Colin Firth’s dour General Erinmore to track down Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) and
                deliver a warning. Aerial reconnaissance has revealed that the apparent retreat of German forces from a
                sector of the Western Front is but a trap to draw the Allies unto the new Hindenburg Line. With all
                telephone lines cut, 1,600 lives at stake and a dawn deadline looming, Schofield and Blake must set
                forth on foot. The odds are not in their favour and when tragedy does strike, it comes far sooner and
                    more brutally than might have been expected. There’s nothing traditionally Hollywood about it.</p>

                <p>That Blake’s elder brother (Richard Madden) stands among those at risk only heightens the stakes. Much
                like Saving Private Ryan before it, 1917 is a tale of dichotomous perspective. It is a story both of the
                wider threat to peace and the very singular drive to save just one life. Unlike Spielberg’s Ryan,
                however, there is precious little room here for the saccharine. Certainly, a stellar score by Thomas
                Newman plays not for sentiment but as pulse racer and outright heart stopper. Deployed in unity with
                Mendes’ breathless momentum, the effect is relentlessly captivating and exists in one of cinema’s most
                immersive, most insatiable, sets. Blockbusters spend millions these days on creating entirely imaginary
                worlds but no longer do viewers truly marvel at the capability of filmmakers to achieve it. With its
                    scratological eye for the grit of earth and realist murk, 1917 is, however, beyond comprehension.</p>

                <p>One can only imagine the choreography that allowed so technical a feat to be achieved but it is a
                testament to Mendes’ skill that such never distracts from the power of his narrative. This is, first and
                    foremost, a beautiful and terrifying thriller. It will take your breath away.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">The gentelman (2020)</h2>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">December 23, 2019 by <a href="#">Jacob</a></p>

                <p>There may be a new sense of Hollywood swish and flick glamour to Guy Ritchie’s latest film but – make no
                mistake about it – The Gentlemen is a step to the reverse from the director of Lock, Stock and Two
                Smoking Barrels. Forget Aladdin, this is cockney ensemble crime caper comedy through and through.
                Everyone has a riot, there’s language to make a sailor blush and marijuana at every turn. Not that our
                heroes touch the stuff. It’s all about the dosh with this gang of upmarket renegades and each one stands
                to make shed loads. As per his debutant days, Ritchie writes, shoots and produces to the lowest common
                denominator. Devotees will lap it up, while cynics wheel out that old sub-par Tarantino jibe. In the
                middle is a view that The Gentlemen is smutty fun, a tad offensive and undeniably fine tuned.


                </p><p>Of all those thoroughly enjoying their part in an old school Ritchie, Hugh Grant is far and away the
                most endearing. He plays Fletcher, a fantastically sleezy private detective, whose increasingly meta
                part in proceedings wins out by virtue of his unflinching revelry. On a roll of late, Grant makes the
                realisation of so grotty a fellow – fuelled on innuendo, he too is out for the big bucks – seem a
                flippant endeavour, when the reality is far from it. For every ‘darling’ he purrs, a chuckle awaits. For
                every surprise in store, Grant has a wholly unique facial expression to deploy. Would The Gentlemen work
                without Grant? Probably. Would it be as fun? Not at all.

                </p><p>Fletcher’s audience is Charlie Hunnam: Ritchie’s King Arthur and The Gentlemen’s Raymond. A swarthy chap
                – all knitwear and designer hair – Raymond is second in command to the business empire of mid-west Yank
                done good/bad Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey). It’s Mickey around whom the plot revolves, with his
                ploy to retire – by selling off his stately home drug network to fellow American billionaire Matthew
                Berger (Jeremy Strong) – unspooling a network of chaos on the safari of black market commerce around
                him. Indeed, it’s a none too subtle metaphor that literally relates this chaos to the animal kingdom.
                Mickey is the lion and – without a hint of irony – Henry Golding’s Anglo-Chinese whippersnapper: the
                dragon. In Ritchie’s world, it is a mercy that all races aren’t subjected to such derogatory labelling.
                And yet, his is a script that still makes room for a white man to explain why it is not racist to name a
                black man ‘black c**t’. Be warned, the latter word splutters with alarming frequency here.</p>

                <p>In such crass asides, Ritchie fails to earn the air of smugness that pervades his writing – and has for
                years. Flashes of inspiration do, however, strike. The plot, cooked by Ritchie, Ivan Atkinson and Marn
                Davies, is tight and undeniably smart in execution. There is greater wit too here than an excess of
                f**ks might at first suggest. Lines like ‘I’ve seen how the sausage is made, now show me the butcher
                shops’ and an extended rumination on the name Phuc may play to the stalls but the timing is exceptional
                and there’s glee in the immaturity. Ritchie’s patter is well honed and unashamed to embrace the audience
                it targets, at the expense of a sect who’ll hate it. Note also the childish writing that scrawls across
                the screen, nod to ‘fight porn’ and wicked resolution gag involving one scuzzy news editor (Eddie
                Marsan) and one particularly rambunctious pig. As Colin Farrell’s endearing Coach quips: ‘she’s not the
                pig I would have chosen.’ The eyes say it all.

                </p><p>Closest of the film’s assets to meaning and insight is Ritchie’s willingness to muse on the passage of
                time. Two decades have flown by since his first films, whilst grey hairs and wrinkles now crease his
                antiheroes. An awareness of his own burgeoning middle age pervades Ritchie’s tonal approach to the film,
                exploding in unsubtle fits via disparaging presentations of a new young crop who play a rougher game
                than the old timers. As Ritchie has it, their lack of success belies the shifted approach. Here is a
                filmmaker who has learned much from his dip in with the big timers of LA but is resolute to prove he has
                emerged in total tact. In this case, that is to say: Ritchie remains refreshingly tactless.
